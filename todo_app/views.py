# Create your views here.

# we get objects when we request
# but we need to send json or http when we send response
# request is compulsory to be taken as param in every views and sending a reponse is also necessary

    # before when fetching data from the database, the data used to come in raw form as tuples. Accessing values required using indexes, which was difficult. 
    # But now, by using objects, all the data comes as objects, making it easy to access attributes directly.
